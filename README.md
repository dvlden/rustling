# Rustlings ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

Here you can find solutions for the rustlings exercises. 
When I took these, they were on tag v4.0.0. Since exercises get updates, you may not find the solutions to the new exercises in this repo.

Link to the original repository where you can start Rustling:
[Original Repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

### Prerequisites (for macOS)

- XCode
- Rust
- Cargo

### Getting started

- Clone the repo and `cd` to it
- Run `cargo install`
- Run `rustlings verify`

All tests will pass and there won't be anything left to do, but this is just a repository that can serve as a reference, to help other people get past the struggle of some exercises.

**Do not look, unless you are really exhausted and do not have a solution!**
